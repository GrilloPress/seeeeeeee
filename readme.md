# Learning C

Yeah, i'm learning C. This is just the place that I'll save my early days in C.

At worst, it'll be like learning Latin and getting a better understanding of languages like Ruby, JavaScript etc.

It'll likely make me a better programmer and give me something new to look at outside of work.

It may even grow into something more or support my growth into that something more.

## Things I've learned or stupid "so that is why" things

I don't have a computer science background and I've done little to no real static typed programming. Nevermind low level programming before so a lot of the really stupid "Why is it called puts in Ruby" stuff are now clearer.
